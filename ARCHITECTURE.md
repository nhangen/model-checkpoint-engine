# System Architecture

## Overview

The ML Model Checkpoint Engine is a generic, framework-agnostic checkpoint management system designed for scalability, performance, and extensibility in machine learning projects.

## Design Principles

### Framework Agnostic
- **Storage Abstraction**: Works with PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX, and custom formats
- **Generic Interfaces**: No assumptions about model architecture or training process
- **Pluggable Backends**: Extensible storage and database backends
- **Universal Metadata**: Framework-neutral checkpoint and experiment tracking

### Performance Optimization
- **Database Layer**: WAL mode SQLite, connection pooling, optimized queries
- **Memory Management**: LRU caching with configurable limits
- **Concurrent Operations**: Thread-safe design with proper locking
- **Integrity Verification**: Efficient SHA256 checksum computation

### Extensibility
- **Hook System**: Event-driven architecture for custom functionality
- **Storage Backends**: Pluggable storage implementations
- **Database Flexibility**: Support for SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL
- **Modular Design**: Loosely coupled components for easy extension

## Core Architecture

## Data Flow

```
Training Application
     ↓
ExperimentTracker → Database Layer (Metadata)
     ↓
EnhancedCheckpointManager
     ↓
Hook System (Pre-save) → Storage Backend → Hook System (Post-save)
     ↓
Integrity Verification → Caching Layer → Database (Checkpoint Record)
     ↓
Retention Policies → Cleanup (if needed)
```

## Database Schema

### Core Tables
- `experiments`: Project metadata, configuration, and tags
- `checkpoints`: Model checkpoint metadata and file paths
- `experiment_metrics`: Time-series performance metrics

### Schema Features
- Indexed on frequently queried columns (experiment_id, created_at, etc.)
- Foreign key constraints for data integrity
- Flexible JSON columns for extensible metadata storage
- WAL mode for concurrent read/write performance
- Connection pooling to minimize overhead

## Storage Backends

### PyTorch Backend
- Native `.pt` format with `torch.save()`
- Optimized for PyTorch model serialization
- Supports model, optimizer, and scheduler states

### SafeTensors Backend (Future)
- Memory-safe tensor serialization
- Cross-framework compatibility
- Faster loading with metadata validation

### Pluggable Architecture
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class StorageBackend(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def save_checkpoint(self, data: Any, path: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Save checkpoint data to storage"""
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def load_checkpoint(self, path: str, device=None) -> Any:
        """Load checkpoint data from storage"""
        pass
```

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimizations
- Connection pooling for concurrent operations
- WAL mode SQLite for better read/write performance
- Indexed queries on frequently accessed columns
- Batch operations for improved throughput

### Memory Management
- LRU caching for checkpoint metadata
- Configurable cache sizes and TTL values
- Efficient memory usage patterns
- Connection reuse to minimize overhead

### Scalability Features
- Thread-safe operations with proper locking
- Concurrent checkpoint operations
- Efficient cleanup of old checkpoints
- Minimal memory footprint for large checkpoint files

## Security & Reliability

### Data Integrity
- SHA256 checksums for all stored data
- Verification on load with automatic corruption detection
- Integrity tracking throughout the system lifecycle

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error isolation in hook system
- Graceful degradation when components fail
- Detailed logging for debugging and monitoring
- Rollback capabilities for failed operations

### Reliability Features
- Atomic database operations
- Backup creation before modifications
- Comprehensive audit trail of all operations
- Recovery mechanisms for corrupted data

## Extension Points

### Hook Development
```python
from model_checkpoint.hooks import BaseHook, HookEvent

class CustomHook(BaseHook):
    def execute(self, context):
        # Custom logic here
        return True

# Register with the hook manager
manager.hook_manager.register_hook(CustomHook())
```

### Storage Backend Development
```python
from model_checkpoint.checkpoint.storage import BaseStorageBackend

class CustomStorageBackend(BaseStorageBackend):
    def save_checkpoint(self, data, path):
        # Custom storage logic
        pass
    
    def load_checkpoint(self, path, device=None):
        # Custom loading logic  
        pass
```

This architecture provides a solid foundation for generic ML checkpoint management while remaining extensible and performant across different use cases and frameworks.
        # Custom logic here
        pass
```

### Custom Storage Backends
```python
from model_checkpoint.storage.base_backend import BaseStorageBackend

class CustomBackend(BaseStorageBackend):
    def save(self, data, path):
        # Custom serialization
        pass
```

### API Extensions
```python
from model_checkpoint.api.base_api import BaseAPI

class CustomAPI(BaseAPI):
    def custom_endpoint(self, request):
        # Custom functionality
        pass
```

This architecture ensures maintainability, performance, and extensibility while achieving zero redundancy optimization across all system components.
